### Hello!   <img width = "75px" src="https://i.imgur.com/bICmRHi_d.jpg?maxwidth=520&shape=thumb&fidelity=high"/>

I'm [**Aby**](https://abyhuerta.github.io/aby/), a computer science student from Texas, US.

I currently work as a comp sci. tutor for the [**University of Texas at San Antonio**](https://sciences.utsa.edu/computer-science/).

I'm interested in full-stack development and researching in spacecraft systems & digital health.

When I'm not working, I like to follow the developments of science (specifically the cosmos), cooking, and I enjoy creating art.
