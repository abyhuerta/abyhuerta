### Hello!   <img src="https://slackmojis.com/emojis/16128-computer/download"/>

I'm [**Aby**](https://abyhuerta.github.io/aby/), a computer science student from Texas, US.

I currently work as a comp sci. tutor for the [**Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers**](https://shpe.org/about-shpe/) & [**Papaya**](https://papayatutor.com/?page_id=922).

I'm interested in full-stack development and researching in spacecraft systems & digital health.

When I'm not working, I like to follow the developments of science (specifically the cosmos), cooking and I enjoy creating art.
