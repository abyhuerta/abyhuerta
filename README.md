### Hello!   <img src="whale_shark.gif" alt="Whale Shark" width="100">


I'm [**Aby**](http://abyroxana.com/), a computer science student from Texas, US.

I currently work as a full-stack developer @ [**UTSA Scooter Lab**](https://scooterlab.utsa.edu/).

I'm interested in full-stack development and researching in spacecraft systems & digital health.

When I'm not working, I like to follow the developments of science (specifically the cosmos), cooking, and I enjoy creating art.
